# ModelList

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of ModelList is to create an S3 class ModelList which is a container of regression or other models. There are methods for summary and predict that can be used on this class. This was created for HW3 in PH290 at UCB.

## Installation

You can install this version of ModelList from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("madelineadee/PH290-ModelList")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(ModelList)

# create two sets of data
df <- mtcars
sample <- sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), nrow(df), replace=TRUE, prob=c(0.5,0.5))
train  <- df[sample, ]
test   <- df[!sample, ]

mod1 <- lm(mpg ~ cyl, train)
mod2 <- lm(mpg ~ cyl + am, train)

# create the ModelList container of models
mList <- CreateModelList(mod1, mod2)

# summary method for ModelList class
summary(mList)

# prediction method for ModelList class
predict(mList, test)

```
